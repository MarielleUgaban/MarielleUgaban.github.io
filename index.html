        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-year college student majoring in the field of Psychology. I currently study at the University of California, Riverside. 
I have been a military kid my whole life, so I have moved around a lot. Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed to various services helping organizations wherever it was needed. I have cooked food for churches, soldiers, and Afghanistan refugees. My first job was in Ramstein, Germany, in a little boba shop. I was with the business from its beginning until I had to leave for college. I learned a lot from the shop, from the struggles of starting a small business to growing and maintaining it. Before my job, I had been oblivious to what it takes to create something from the ground up. On the first day of opening, the line outside the store wrapped along the mall hallways. Despite the little bumps of getting used to the demand and labor, it was insightful to be part of the growth. An overlooked part was the amount of work that goes unseen. Keeping track of all of the supplies needed, even overseas, was the foundation of the shopâ€™s success.<br><br>

        Whether working with a partner or as part of a larger team, I consistently focus on making sure that everyone involved feels supported and united. Some of my proudest moments involve charity because of how good it feels to be selfless and do something for people who need it. Seeing communities come together for events such as the Ukrainian blanket drive I organized to donate for people with only the clothes on their backs taught me the importance of humanity. To remember that everyone is human and there is always someone out there to help.
My professional strengths include being able to lead and instruct effectively, my emotional intelligence, and being able to adapt to various workplaces. Iâ€™m known for being friendly, responsible, and hardworking. Iâ€™ve also often been recognized for being able to bring people together. I enjoy solving emotional conflicts and thrive when collaborating with others to work toward similar goals in the workplace. 
<br><br>

        Outside of my main role, Iâ€™m passionate about music, community work, and traveling. I often spend time playing my violin, volunteering, or hiking with friends. These interests keep me grounded and allow me to connect with others in meaningful ways beyond just the professional environment. 
I also take my education very seriously and regularly engage in studying, going to classes, or doing homework to stay up to date and successful in school. 
Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited to continue growing in my Psychology major and contributing to projects that better help me understand humanity. Iâ€™m always open to new collaborations, learning opportunities, or simply connecting with other professionals who share similar passions.
